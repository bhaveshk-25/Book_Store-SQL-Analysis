# Book_Store-SQL-Analysis
SQL-based analysis of a bookstore dataset using PostgreSQL, focusing on sales, customers, and inventory insights.

## 📖 Project Description
This project involves analyzing a **Bookstore database** using **PostgreSQL** to extract meaningful business insights related to **books, customers, and orders**. The objective is to demonstrate strong SQL skills by solving both **basic and advanced analytical queries** on a relational dataset.

---

## 🎯 Project Objectives
- Analyze book sales and customer purchasing behavior
- Perform genre-wise and author-wise sales analysis
- Identify top customers and high-performing books
- Practice real-world SQL concepts on relational data

---

## 🗄️ Data Source
- **Source:** Open-source bookstore dataset obtained from GitHub
